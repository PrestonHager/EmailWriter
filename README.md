# EmailWriter

This email writer is made for Bit by Bit Coding.
The general premise is that the user may input any text into predetermined text boxes to create a more proffesional looking email.
The exported document is an HTML file with complete inline styling and resources.
This final HTML file may then be send as an email.

### TODO List

 + Add semi-rich text editor to main body
 + Ability to add inline button to main body
 + Remove/hide the footer (top half)
 + More fonts?
